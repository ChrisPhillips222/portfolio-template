<p>
 -changed images to reflect image content
<br>
-moved some CSS classes from divs to structural elements in order to lessen div content both in the main index page and in the navigation and footer includes.
 <br>
-fixed breakpoints so that navbar-brand (my name header etc...) would appear correctly in different views
